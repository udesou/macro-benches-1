# goblint

Goblint is a static analyser for C, based on abstract interpretation with relational
(apron) domains. This benchmark runs it (via the SV-COMP `svcomp.json` config —
interval + octagon/apron) on a bit-vector verification task. It is the suite's
second independent C abstract-interpreter (after frama-c) and the purest
allocation-churn ladder — the reproducer for the OCaml 5 allocation regression
tracked in ocaml#13733.

## Ladder

Input size = the **size of the analysed C program**. `goblint.build.sh` generates a
synthetic Btor2C-style bit-vector state machine — `N` state variables updated in a
`for(;;)` loop via masked bit-vector logic, in the same shape as the frozen `bench.c`
— and analyses it with the same config. A bigger `N` means more variables tracked
and more program points, so the constraint solver does proportionally more fixpoint
work; the values are masked so each rung reaches a fixpoint and proves every assert
safe. Measured on OCaml 5.5.0, Ryzen 9 9950X (`fingerprint.sh` `v=0x400`; olly from
`perf_grp1|re-25|md-2`):

| rung | N | wall | RSS | gc% | allocated | minor GC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `small` | 100 | 4.3s | 77 MB | 22% | 3.83 G w | 14645 |
| `default` | 165 | 16.3s | 120 MB | 27% | 14.0 G w | 53525 |
| `large` | 240 | 46.6s | 186 MB | 34% | 39.5 G w | 150770 |

The octagon domain is O(N²), so wall and allocation grow super-linearly:
`allocated_words` climbs 3.83 → 39.5 G (10×) and minor collections 15k → 151k while
peak RSS stays modest (77 → 186 MB). **Read this ladder by allocation volume, not
RSS** — it is exactly goblint's #13733 signature (roughly 4× more allocated bytes on
5.x for identical output), and a pure on-heap counterpoint to pplacer's off-heap GSL
footprint. A huge band is deferred (N≈340 would be ~min-scale).

## Legacy

Kept for reference, not run by default (`RUNNING_TAG=legacy`):

- `goblint` — the FROZEN exact reproducer for ocaml#13733: the fixed ~5.6 KB SV-COMP
  input `btor2c-lazyMod.vcegar_QF_BV_itc99_b13_p02.c`. Too short (~0.2s) for a macro
  rung, but kept because it is the issue repro.

## Notes

- apron is genuinely required (the svcomp config and autotuner both enable it) and is
  non-dune (configure/make + camlidl), so it is the fiddliest build in the suite:
  `scripts/vendor-apron.sh` builds the camlidl/mlgmpidl/apron chain per-runtime into a
  self-contained prefix, exposed to the otherwise-hermetic dune build via `OCAMLPATH`.
- The output `goblint-<runtime>` is a wrapper script (it puts apron's shared libs on
  the loader path and points `pre.custom_includes` at the vendored stub dirs).
- Five vendored-source patches are needed to build on a modern toolchain (goblint.h
  for GCC 14+/C23, a `cpu` `config.h`, a `bare_encoding` install fix, a
  `json-data-encoding` re-alignment, and a first-class-module annotation for 5.5+).

## The apron prefix

goblint links apron, whose 14 shared objects (`libapron.so`, `libpolka*.so`, `liboct*.so`, ...)
are built by `goblint.build.sh` step 1 into `vendor/.apron_prefix-<runtime>/lib`. **Nothing else
creates that prefix** — `setup-monorepo.sh` does not vendor apron — so anything that wipes
`vendor/` without rebuilding goblint leaves `goblint.exe`'s RUNPATH dangling. The only symptom is

    goblint.exe: error while loading shared libraries: libpolkaMPQ.so

and exit 127 on every invocation. That happened once for a whole sweep: running-ng skips the
build when the output binary already exists, so the prefix was never recreated, and all 360
invocations failed while being counted as completed cells. If you see exit 127 from goblint,
delete `benchmarks/goblint/goblint*-<runtime>` and let it rebuild.

The wrapper puts `${APRON_PREFIX}/lib` on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as a fallback for a relocated or
RUNPATH-stripped binary. Note the `.so` live in `lib`, not `lib/apron` (which holds only
`.a`/`.cma`/`.idl`), and the wrapper fails with a clear message if the prefix is missing.

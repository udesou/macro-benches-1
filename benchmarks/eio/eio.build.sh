# Two benchmarks share this build, selected by output name:
#   * eio_conc_* — the input-size concurrency ladder (eio_conc_bench.exe). input size =
#     number of independent producer/consumer fiber pairs (argv.1), each on its
#     own bounded stream, so the working set (live fibers + buffered data) grows
#     ~linearly. The frozen eio_fiber_stream is a throughput bench with a tiny,
#     constant live set; this scales concurrency instead. The rung differs only
#     in its macro_base arg (n_pairs).
#   * eio_fiber_stream (default) — the frozen throughput benchmark, unchanged.

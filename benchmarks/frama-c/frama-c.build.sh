# frama-c.build.sh — build the Frama-C EVA benchmark from the monorepo.
#
# Builds a standalone executable that statically links the Frama-C kernel
# + the EVA (value/abstract-interpretation) plugin (see benchmarks/frama-c/dune),
# then emits a wrapper that runs EVA on a C workload.
#
# The wrapper sets two things the static, uninstalled build needs:
#   * -no-autoload-plugins : EVA is statically registered, so the dune-site
#       plugin loader must NOT run (there is no plugin site to discover).
#   * DUNE_DIR_LOCATIONS   : points Frama-C's dune-site "share"/"lib" sites
#       at the vendored source tree (frama-c:share:<root> resolves to
#       <root>/share, which holds machdeps/, libc/, ...).  Without this the
#       uninstalled binary crashes in System_config (List.hd of empty site).
#
# Two workloads, selected by the wrapper's first argument:
#   t       (default) : EVA on t.c (zlib, ~17.5k lines) — abstract-interp
#                       focused, fast (~0.4s on 5.5.0). Small/simple: EVA never
#                       accumulates enough abstract states for slevel/precision
#                       to matter, so this is a fixed fast standalone, NOT a
#                       input-size ladder rung.
#   sqlite [PREC]     : EVA on the SQLite amalgamation (sqlite3.c, ~258k
#                       lines) via a small driver — stresses the weak/
#                       ephemeron hashconsing of a huge CIL AST + EVA state
#                       (the OCaml-5 regression of ocaml#11733).  The optional
#                       second arg PREC is the EVA precision level (-eva-precision
#                       0..11; default 0 ≈ the legacy -eva-slevel 0 run, ~7s /
#                       460MB).  Precision is the input-size axis: raising it keeps
#                       more abstract states → bigger live heap + more
#                       hash-consing (P0 7s/457MB → P2 18s/641MB → P3+ minutes).
#                       NOTE: -eva-slevel does NOT scale this workload (measured
#                       flat 0→500); -eva-precision does.
# Any other arguments are passed straight through to the EVA executable.
#
# assigns:missing is downgraded from error→feedback for the sqlite run:
# the amalgamation calls spec-less libc/OS functions that would otherwise
# abort EVA; we want it to keep analysing, not prove soundness.

    # Two defines pin the *analysed program*, which otherwise depends on the host
    # gcc. Frama-C preprocesses with \`gcc -E -undef -imacros __fc_builtin_macros.h\`,
    # so __GNUC__ is stripped and sqlite3.c's GCC_VERSION is 0 on every host. Its
    # atomics gate is therefore decided entirely by the second half of
    #   #if GCC_VERSION>=4007000 || __has_extension(c_atomic)
    # and sqlite3.c self-guards \`#ifndef __has_extension -> define it to 0\`. So on
    # gcc >= 14 (which predefines __has_extension) EVA analyses AtomicLoad as an
    # undeclared __atomic_load_n -- cheap and imprecise -- while on gcc 13 it
    # analyses the real volatile/mutex code, an enormously bigger state space: the
    # same benchmark took 7s here and blew past a 600s limit on a gcc 13.3 runner.
    # -D__has_extension(x)=1 forces the intrinsics path everywhere, so every host
    # analyses what the benchmark was characterised on. (Frama-C already passes
    # -Wno-builtin-macro-redefined, so redefining it on gcc >= 14 is quiet, and
    # nothing else in sqlite3.c or Frama-C's libc uses __has_extension.) The inner
    # single quotes matter: Frama-C runs the preprocessor through a shell, so an
    # unquoted \`(\` aborts with \`sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected\`.
    #
    # -DLONGDOUBLE_TYPE=double: sqlite3.c gates its long-double code at runtime on
    # \`sqlite3Config.bUseLongDouble = sizeof(LONGDOUBLE_TYPE)>8\`. Where that is
    # true, EVA walks into the branch and Frama-C 32.1 aborts on an unimplemented
    # feature ("Builtins for long double type"), exit 3. SQLite documents
    # LONGDOUBLE_TYPE as an override, and setting it to double makes the gate
    # false. Measured effect on this analysis: bUseLongDouble drops to 0 and one
    # alarm of 87 disappears (the signed-overflow alarm inside the long-double
    # detection code itself) -- the other 12000+ log lines are identical.
    #
    # This define alone is NOT sufficient at low -eva-precision. The gate folds
    # to 0 only when EVA can keep the bUseLongDouble global precise; at
    # -eva-precision 0/1 (the small rung) it widens the global to {0;1}, analyses
    # BOTH arms, and still hits the 1.0e+119L long-double *literals* -> the same
    # exit-3 abort, on every host. (It reproduces locally too; CI just surfaced it
    # first because only the small rung, precision 0, is flagged ci_run.) So the
    # three bUseLongDouble branches in sqlite3.c are additionally neutralised with
    # \`if( 0 && ... )\` (grep "no long double builtins"), forcing EVA down the
    # portable non-long-double path at every precision. That is a benign SQLite
    # config (the path used wherever high-precision long double is unavailable)
    # and irrelevant to what this benchmark measures.

# infer.build.sh — build the java-only Infer static analyzer and emit its
# benchmark wrapper.  Mirrors benchmarks/goblint/goblint.build.sh (per-runtime
# non-dune prefix + hermetic in-tree dune build), except the non-dune deps are
# javalib + sawja (scripts/vendor-javalib-sawja.sh) rather than apron.
#
# Infer itself is vendored manually (vendor/infer, via scripts/vendor-infer.sh):
# its upstream build is autoconf+make that *generates* dune files, so it can't
# join the opam-monorepo lock; instead a java-only pre-generated dune overlay is
# laid down at vendor time and it builds as an ordinary in-tree dune project.
#
# WORKLOAD.  Infer's *multicore* (domains, shared-heap) analysis of a fixed
# subset of a real Java corpus.  Bytecode capture (javalib, JVM-free) is done
# here at build time; the emitted wrapper runs ONLY `infer analyze --multicore`
# on a fresh copy of that capture, so running-ng measures the shared-heap
# parallel analysis — the mode where olly/runtime_events sees all GC activity in
# one process.  Capture and analyze use the SAME per-runtime binary, so the
# marshalled capture DB never crosses an OCaml-version boundary.
#
# TUNING.  Workload size = the rung's roots subset (benchmarks/infer/roots_<rung>.idx),
# a committed slice of the corpus's ~11k classes.  small/default/large hold
# 72/215/542 roots (warm -j12 ~9/16/44s on a 32-core box; the full corpus is ~20x
# the large rung, so there is years of headroom).  To retune for a farm, resample
# each rung:
#   infer debug --source-files -o <capture> | grep '\.class$' | sort \
#     | awk 'NR % K == 1' > benchmarks/infer/roots_<rung>.idx
# and pick K per rung so its wall lands where you want.  Parallelism is INFER_JOBS
# (default 12); a fork/parmap wall-clock companion is INFER_MULTICORE=0.

#    never sets it, so it always sees the duniverse copies.  We therefore hide
#    the duniverse duplicates for the duration of infer's build and restore
#    them on exit (same source/version as the prefix copies, so nothing else

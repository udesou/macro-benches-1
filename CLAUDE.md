# CLAUDE.md — working notes for agents & contributors on `macro-benches`

Auto-loaded context for Claude Code (and a reference for contributors). The
human-facing docs are `README.md` and the per-benchmark pages under
`docs/benchmarks/<name>.md`. This file holds the operational and machine-facing
detail that doesn't belong in either: the build-script contract, the in-process
iteration and ring-size mechanics, the vendored-source patch table, the
runtime-feature coverage matrix and gaps, the gotchas, and the backlog.

## What this is

- A **dune monorepo** of real-world OCaml programs used as macro-benchmarks (coq,
  frama-c, goblint, alt-ergo, menhir, cpdf, owl, jsoo, irmin, liquidsoap,
  ocamlformat, decompress, eio, sedlex, yojson, zarith, pplacer, devkit, infer, …). All
  third-party deps are **vendored** under `duniverse/` (opam-monorepo), so every
  runtime compiles byte-identical source. 23 tools (21 active; `merlin` and
  `lavyek` disabled — see their doc pages). ocamlc counts as one tool but spans
  two benchmark dirs (ocamlc-self-compile + ocamlc-compile-uucp); `infer` is
  vendored manually (not opam-monorepo) — see its doc page and the patch table.
- **Input-size ladder + tags.** Each tool has `small`/`default`/`large` (a few
  also `huge`) rungs whose input reaches a different GC/runtime regime, not just a
  scaled-up copy. The selection lives in running-ng's `macro_base.yml` `tags:`
  (`default_run`/`small_run`/`large_run`/`huge_run`/`legacy`/`all_benches`); a bare
  run auto-applies `default_run`. **Legacy** = the pre-ladder anchors, extra
  per-tool workloads, and frozen issue reproducers (`liq_video_frames_pool` #14533,
  `goblint` #13733) — kept, run only with `RUNNING_TAG=legacy`. In THIS repo the
  same split is in `benchmarks/manifest.yml`: all 95 programs listed (build-all),
  the 20 small rungs flagged `ci_run: true` (what CI runs, via `ci-manifest.py
  list-run`). The `knob-a-rungs` branch name is historical — docs say "input-size
  ladder".
- Driven by `~/running-ng` (suite type `OCamlBenchmarkSuite`, **not** the
  satellite-switch path): each benchmark has `benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>.build.sh` that
  runs `dune build` with the runtime compiler on PATH, into a **per-runtime build dir**
  `_build-<runtime>`, then copies/links out the binary `benchmarks/<tool>/<prog>-<runtime>`.

## Hard rules (do not violate)

- **Do not comment on PRs, or add to PRs, unless explicitly asked to.**
- No "Claude"/Anthropic/Co-Authored-By: Claude in further commit messages.
- **Remote is `origin = github.com/ocaml-bench/macro-benches`** — a *shared org*
  repo, not a personal fork. Be careful pushing; commit/push only when asked.
- **Never delete an individual file inside a `_build-<runtime>/` tree** to "force a
  rebuild" — it corrupts dune's incremental state (you'll get `*.impl.d: No such file`
  / missing `.sexp`). To force a re-probe/rebuild, remove the **whole**
  `_build-<runtime>` dir (or `dune clean`), and delete the benchmark's **output**
  binary so running-ng rebuilds it.
- **Don't commit `_build-*/`, `_rocq_prefix/`, big inputs, or vendored-source churn**
  casually. `duniverse/` is generated (opam-monorepo); regenerate via `scripts/`.
- Keep documentation consistent with every commit: `README.md`, the relevant
  `docs/benchmarks/<name>.md`, and this file.

## Where things live (read first)

- `benchmarks/<tool>/` — `<tool>.build.sh` (called by running-ng) + input data.
- `benchmarks/manifest.yml` — **the program list**: name → tool, build script, args.
  Needed because several build scripts derive their dune target from the *output
  filename*, so the scripts alone don't say what programs exist. CI reads this.
- `docs/benchmarks/<name>.md` — human-facing page per benchmark.
- `duniverse/` — vendored dependency sources (the actual compiled code).
- `vendor/` — manually vendored bits (camlpdf, cpdf-source, zarith, pplacer, frama-c, apron, …).
- `scripts/` — `setup-monorepo.sh`, `vendor-*.sh` (coq, apron, frama-c, cpdf, …),
  `ci-build-all.sh` / `ci-run-all.sh` / `ci-manifest.py` (the CI phases).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — master-only build + run-once gate (see §CI).
- `sources.yml`, `macro-bench-*.opam(.template)`, `dune-workspace`, `dune-overlays`.
- `_build-<runtime>/` — per-runtime dune build output (gitignored).

## Build / run

`README.md` §Build-script contract states the variable table for humans and
points here for everything below — keep the two in sync.

running-ng calls `<tool>.build.sh` with the runtime compiler on PATH and these
env vars:

| Variable | Meaning | Fallback when unset |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| `RUNNING_OCAML_BENCH_DIR` | Directory with this benchmark's sources (`benchmarks/<tool>/`) | the script's own directory |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_OUTPUT` | Path where the built binary must be written | `${BENCH_DIR}/<tool>-${RUNTIME_NAME}` |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_RUNTIME_NAME` | Runtime identifier (e.g. `ocaml-5.4.1`) | `runtime` |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH` | Opam switch name (when applicable) | unset |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH_PREFIX` | Prefix of the runtime's switch. Only `ocamlc-self-compile`, `ocamlc-compile-uucp` and `jsoo` need it — they run the runtime's *own* `ocamlc` / `ocamlc.byte` as the workload, so they need the switch, not just a compiler on PATH | `opam var prefix --switch "$RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH"` when that is set, else the `ocamlc` on PATH |

A script first clears the ambient `OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX`,
`OCAMLTOP_INCLUDE_PATH`, `CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `OCAMLLIB` and `OCAMLPATH` so a
previously active switch can't contaminate the build with its `.cmi`s (the few
benchmarks needing a library path — goblint's apron, coq's rocq prefix — set
`OCAMLPATH` themselves afterwards), then `dune build --root <monorepo>
--build-dir _build-<runtime> --profile release <target>` and copies the result
out. Because every benchmark lives at `benchmarks/<tool>/`, each script derives
the monorepo root from `BENCH_DIR` (`$(cd "${BENCH_DIR}/../.." && pwd)`); no
macro-specific env var is needed, and the contract matches `~/benches/`
name-for-name. (`RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR` is a *run*-time variable — the
manifest's `args` interpolate it to reach input files — not a build-time one.)

Because `_build-<runtime>` is keyed by the runtime tag, two runtimes never
clobber each other; benches shares one `_build/` per benchmark across runtimes,
so switching runtime there rebuilds from scratch.

**`RUNNING_OCAML_OUTPUT` selects the program**, not just the destination. Where
one script backs several programs (`eio.build.sh` → `eio_fiber_stream` + the
`eio_conc_*` ladder; `ahrefs-devkit.build.sh` → seven; also cpdf, goblint, jsoo,
pplacer, ocamlc-compile-uucp) they differ in *dune target*, and the script cases
on `basename "${OUT}"` (or `BM_NAME`, that basename minus the runtime suffix) to
pick it. This is the one place the contract is load-bearing beyond "write the
binary here" — benches has no equivalent, because programs sharing a script there
build the same binary and differ only in the config's arguments. `ci-manifest.py
check` only cross-checks the `case "${BM_NAME}"` / `case "${OUT_BASE}"` form
(ahrefs-devkit today); a `case "$(basename "${OUT}")"` block is invisible to it.

**Generated inputs are the build script's job** — there is no
`<name>.build.deps.sh` split as in benches. alt-ergo's `fill_x100.why` and
congruence chains, goblint's state machines, ocamlformat's line ladder and jsoo's
replicated sources are generated in the build script, skipped if already present,
and gitignored. Runtime-independent ones are generated once and shared by every
runtime in a sweep; the ones that must be built *by the runtime under test*
(jsoo's and `ocamlc-compile-uucp`'s bytecode) carry the runtime tag in their
filename instead. Manifest entries whose `args` name such a file need
`inputs_generated: true` (see §CI check 4).

Outputs come in two shapes — copied binaries and wrapper scripts that `exec` into
`_build-<runtime>/`. Both satisfy the contract; see §Gotchas before deleting a
build directory by hand.

Standalone usage (no running-ng): set `RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR=~/macro-benches` and
drive `~/running-ng`'s `build_ocaml_binaries_gc_sweep.sh` / `run_ocaml_bench_gc_sweep.sh`.
Or drive the build straight from the manifest: `bash scripts/ci-build-all.sh`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on **pull requests into `master`** and on **pushes
to `master`** (plus a weekly cron and `workflow_dispatch`); nothing runs on other
branch pushes. The PR run is the gate; the post-merge run exists because the
required check is not `strict`, so two PRs can each be green against an older
`master` and still break it together — without a push run, nothing would notice
until the next PR or the Monday cron. It is cheap (same cache key as the PR run
that just passed) and it refreshes the cache in `master`'s scope, which is the only
scope every PR can restore from. Note `cancel-in-progress` is deliberately limited
to PR runs: superseding a PR run is right, but cancelling a `master` run would
leave the merge that triggered it unverified.

Two matrix legs: the
**latest stable release**, which gates, and the **`ocaml/ocaml` trunk tip**, which
is `continue-on-error` because it tracks a moving compiler and needs ppxlib/lwt
git `main` (patches 4+5 below). The trunk leg resolves the tip commit *before*
creating the switch and folds the SHA into every cache key — otherwise a restored
opam-root cache silently tests a stale trunk.

The gate is enforced by branch protection on `master`: the required check is
`build + run once (stable)`. The matrix `label` is deliberately version-free —
GitHub matches required checks **by name**, so putting `5.5.0` in the label would
orphan the requirement the moment the compiler is bumped.

Three phases, all driven off `benchmarks/manifest.yml`:

- `scripts/ci-manifest.py check` — runs first because it costs seconds. It compares
  **sets**, not just counts, in five directions:
  1. every manifest program's tool dir and build script exist;
  2. every `benchmarks/*/*.build.sh` is claimed by a program or listed under
     `disabled:` — this is what catches a whole new benchmark landing with no
     manifest entry;
  3. a build script that dispatches on the program name (`case "${BM_NAME}"`, i.e.
     ahrefs-devkit today) accepts *exactly* the programs the manifest claims for it
     — this is what catches a new program added to an **existing** tool, where the
     build script already exists so (2) stays quiet. Both directions are errors: a
     `case` arm with no manifest entry, and a manifest entry the `case` would reject
     with `Unknown benchmark`;
  4. every in-tree input path in a program's `args` exists, so a program can't be
     added without committing its input. Generated inputs opt out with
     `inputs_generated: true` — the `alt_ergo_{fill,chain_small,chain_default,
     chain_large}` and `ocamlformat_rocq_{small,default,large}` entries, whose
     `.why`/`.ml` inputs are built by their build script and gitignored, so a
     fresh checkout does not have them. Benchmarks that generate inputs but take a
     rung *selector* rather than a path (goblint, jsoo) need no flag: the check
     only looks at in-tree paths in `args`;
  5. one `docs/benchmarks/<tool>.md` per tool, both directions.

  It prints the counts it compared (`24 benchmark directories = 22 with programs
  + 2 disabled`, `95 programs`, `24 docs pages`) so the log shows the numbers,
  then lists every problem it found rather than stopping at the first. (21 not 20
  because the compiler tool spans two directories: ocamlc-self-compile and
  ocamlc-compile-uucp.)

- `scripts/ci-build-all.sh` — builds every program into `_build-ci`. Deletes the
  output binary first, so a stale wrapper can't make a build look successful (the
  `exit 127` trap in §Gotchas).
- `scripts/ci-run-all.sh` — runs each program once, with its manifest args, from a
  fresh scratch cwd so relative outputs (menhir's `--base`, goblint's
  `witness.yml`) don't land in the tree.

Neither stops at the first failure: a hermeticity break usually takes several
benchmarks with it, and one run should show all of them. Both write a table to
`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and leave per-program logs in `ci-logs/`.

Notes for whoever touches this next:

- **`args` in the manifest are copied verbatim from running-ng's `macro_base.yml`**
  so the two lists can be diffed mechanically. Keep it that way.
- **`expected_exit`** declares a by-design non-zero exit. Only `alt_ergo_unsat_smt2`
  needs it today: `--timelimit 15` means the workload *is* "solve for 15 s", the goal
  never closes, and alt-ergo dies of its own SIGVTALRM (128+14 = **142**) on every
  run. Don't "fix" that by dropping the flag — the time limit is the workload.
- **In the manifest rows, `args` is the last column on purpose.** Bash treats TAB as
  whitespace-IFS, so an empty field mid-row collapses and shifts every later column;
  the programs with no args would silently take the next field as their argv.
- **Ladder rungs are deliberately absent.** The base rung is the signal CI needs,
  and the big rungs don't fit a hosted runner (sedlex's large rung peaks near
  27 GB RSS). When rungs land on master, list only the `_small` one.
- **`SKIP_TEST_BUILD=1`** makes `setup-monorepo.sh` skip its `[9/9]` test build.
  CI sets it because that step targets the default `_build/` while the build
  scripts target `_build-<tag>/` — running both compiles the duniverse twice.
- **Dune is pinned per leg**: `3.22.1` on stable, git `main` on trunk (released
  dune can't bootstrap against 5.6). Patch 19 is what lets the trunk leg work at
  all — its dune is ≥ 3.24, which deleted the `coq` extension vendored rocq
  declared. The stable pin is for determinism, not necessity: the workspace parses
  under both 3.22.1 and 3.24 now, and pinning keeps the build environment fixed
  the same way every source is pinned.
- The **weekly cron run skips the cache** on purpose. Everything is pinned now
  (see §Vendored source pins), so this is not a drift detector — it is a check
  that a *cold* setup still works: that every pinned commit and tarball is still
  fetchable, that the rocq bootstrap works from nothing, and that the cache we
  rely on the rest of the week isn't hiding a broken setup path.

## Vendored source pins

`sources.yml` is the single source of truth for every third-party version this
repo vendors, and `scripts/lib-sources.sh` is how the scripts read it:

- `src_field <key> <field>` — one field out of `sources.yml`. Deliberately awk, not
  PyYAML, so setup still works on a machine with only bash, git, curl and a
  compiler.
- `clone_pinned <key> <dir>` — clone a git source at its pinned commit. Idempotent
  (no-op when the checkout is already at the pin), and it *re-clones when the pin
  moves*, which the old "does the directory exist?" checks could not detect. It
  keeps `.git`, so `git -C <dir> rev-parse HEAD` tells you what you have.

Nothing tracks a branch HEAD any more. Six sources used to — ppxlib, lwt, merlin,
js_of_ocaml, pplacer, mcl — which meant a cold `make setup` vendored whatever
upstream had that morning, silently changing the benchmark binaries and therefore
the measurements. When they were pinned, ppxlib had already drifted 7 weeks past
the validated tree and lwt 3 months; the js_of_ocaml branch had been squashed and
deleted upstream, so a cold clone failed outright.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **js_of_ocaml is pinned to a `master` commit**, not the old `ocaml-5.6` PR
  branch: the 5.6 support landed on master (the `[ 5; 7 ]` bound in
  `compiler/lib/magic_number.ml`) and the branch is gone. Bumping this pin changes
  *two* benchmarks — `ocamlc_self_compile` takes its workload from
  `duniverse/js_of_ocaml/benchmarks/sources/ml`.
- **Pins are commits, never tags.** A tag can be re-pointed upstream. Resolve one
  with `git ls-remote <url> 'refs/tags/<t>^{}'`, which gives the commit; plain
  `refs/tags/<t>` gives the *tag object* for an annotated tag, which is a
  different sha. `clone_pinned` peels a tag-object pin (`_peel_commit`) and
  carries on with a note, because the tag object is immutable too — so the pin is
  still a pin. Prefer the commit anyway: it is what `rev-parse HEAD` will show
  you. Getting this wrong used to fail the *whole* checkout with `checked out
  <sha>, expected <sha>`, and the half-vendored tree it left behind was then
  mis-built by the next caller.
- **`clone_pinned` tries three fetches**: the commit directly (GitHub allows it);
  else the recorded branch/tag shallow, then verifies the commit matches (GitLab
  refuses bare commits — this is the frama-c path, and it is still pinned because
  a moved ref fails the verify: the pinned commit is not in the shallow object
  store, so there is nothing to peel and the compare is against the raw pin);
  else a full clone.
- **`ci-manifest.py check` enforces this**: every `src_field`/`clone_pinned` key
  must exist in `sources.yml` with the fields it asks for, every `commit:` must be
  full 40-hex, and **no script may call `git clone` directly** (only
  `lib-sources.sh`, for the fallback). That last rule is what stops an unpinned
  clone creeping back in.
- Bumping a pin is a one-line edit to `sources.yml` plus `make setup`. It shows up
  in review and CI rebuilds and re-runs everything against it — which is the
  entire point.

## Gotchas (hard-won — don't rediscover)

- **Two kinds of output binary.** Some `<prog>-<runtime>` are **standalone copied
  binaries** (menhir, cpdf, alt-ergo, …); others are **tiny wrapper scripts** that
  `exec` the real `.exe` *inside* `_build-<runtime>/…` (coqc, owl, devkit, jsoo,
  goblint, frama-c, pplacer, liq_video_frames, …). Deleting `_build-<runtime>` leaves
  the wrappers in place, so running-ng thinks they're built, **skips rebuild, and the
  wrapper fails at run with `exit 127, .exe: No such file`** — *not* an MMTk/runtime
  bug. Re-`buildbms` after deleting the wrapper output to regenerate the `.exe`.
- **dune caches configurator probes in `_build`** (e.g. `lwt_features.h`, `*.sexp`).
  An env-var change (e.g. `LIBRARY_PATH`) alone won't re-probe — needs a clean build dir.
- **The duniverse builds across multiple compilers** (5.4.1, `d8bb46c`, trunk,
  5.5.0-rc1, ocaml-mmtk). All programs build on stock 5.5.0-rc1.
- **External C deps:** apron (goblint) needs camlidl + gmp/mpfr; owl needs
  openblas/cblas; cpdf needs camlpdf; these come via `vendor/` + `scripts/vendor-*.sh`.
- **Under ocaml-mmtk** (built via running-ng's `OCamlMMTk`): all 31 *build* (the
  runtime supplies `LIBRARY_PATH`+heap), but a few **crash at run** — see MMTk notes.
- **infer's `extlib`/`camlzip` duplicate-hide window.** javalib/sawja link `extlib` +
  `zip` from infer's per-runtime prefix, but the duniverse *also* ships them (devkit
  depends on both) and dune rejects two libraries with the same public name. The clash
  is only visible while the prefix is on `OCAMLPATH`, so `infer.build.sh` hides
  `duniverse/{ocaml-extlib,camlzip}` for the duration of its dune build and restores
  them via an EXIT trap. Consequence: **don't build infer and devkit concurrently in
  the same tree** — the hide window would break a parallel devkit build. running-ng's
  sequential `buildbms` is fine.
- **infer's overlay links `ounit2`, not `oUnit`.** Infer's upstream-generated dune links
  the legacy findlib alias `oUnit` (which a normal opam switch provides via the
  transitional `ounit` package); the hermetic duniverse ships only the `ounit2` public
  name, so `dune-overlays/infer/.../{clang,unit}/dune` + `src/dune` link `ounit2` (same
  library). This is why infer built piecewise on a full macOS switch but not hermetically
  until the overlay was fixed.

## Per-session workflow

1. Identify which benchmark/tool you're touching; its build glue is
   `benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>.build.sh`; its source is under `duniverse/` or `vendor/`;
   its human doc is `docs/benchmarks/<tool>.md`.
2. Build via running-ng with `RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR` set; don't hand-delete `_build`
   internals.
3. Commit only when asked; don't commit build output.

---

## Iteration counts (in-process loops)

A few benchmarks have per-invocation work that's too short to measure reliably —
startup overhead dominates and observability tools (olly, perf) lose precision.
Two patterns are in use.

**Shell-loop wrapper** (legacy, *broken for olly*). Some build scripts generate a
wrapper that runs the binary `N` times in a shell loop (`for _ in $(seq 1 N); do
"$REAL_EXE"; done`). This works for wall-time aggregation but breaks olly's
runtime_events attach model: olly sees one OCaml process at a time. With short
per-child work the events files stack in `/tmp` and olly aggregates them; with
longer per-child work (e.g. `pplacer_testsuite` at ~3.5 s/child) olly attaches to
the first child only and silently misses the other N−1.

**Env-var / argv in-process loop** (recommended). The OCaml entry point reads a
count and runs the work N times inside the same process; the wrapper just sets the
count and `exec`s the binary. The orchestrator's positional arg becomes the loop
count, one process does N iterations, olly observes the whole thing.

In use by:

| Benchmark | Count via | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pplacer_testsuite` | `PPLACER_TEST_LOOP` env var | OUnit runner; env var avoids clashing with OUnit's argv parsing |
| `owl_gc` | `Sys.argv.(1)` | plain main; argv otherwise unused (default 1) |
| `devkit_stre` | `Sys.argv.(1)` | loops the 8 sub-benches (default 1) |
| `devkit_gzip` | `Sys.argv.(1)` | same shape as stre |
| `devkit_network` | `Sys.argv.(1)` | same shape as stre |
| `liq_video_frames_pool` | `Sys.argv.(1)` | number of frames (repetition); `argv.2`/`argv.3` = frame width/height (input size = resolution) |

Note: `devkit_htmlstream` is **not** in this list — it runs fixed internal
`for _ = 1 to 10` loops and is copied out as a standalone binary, so it ignores
`Sys.argv`. (The top summary table in older READMEs over-generalised this.)

**Ring-size interaction.** One process accumulating events across N iterations
needs a bigger `runtime_events` ring than N separate processes. For
allocation-heavy benches (owl_gc especially) large counts overflow the ring and
olly reports lost events plus a corrupted `wall_time`. Convention: `re-25` (32 MB)
for the in-process-loop benches; bump to `re-26` (64 MB) if a new one hits the
limit. Empirical owl_gc sizing: `re-23` (8 MB) starts corrupting `wall_time` at
arg 5; `re-25` is clean through arg 6 (~16s), the current setting.

When porting a benchmark to this pattern: wrap the entry point with a count
(default 1; env var if it already parses argv, else `Sys.argv.(1)`), drop the
shell `for` loop in the build script, set the orchestrator `args:` to the count,
and if the entry point is upstream code record the patch in `setup-monorepo.sh` so
it survives a re-vendor.

## MMTk (`ocaml-mmtk`) notes

Built via running-ng's `OCamlMMTk` runtime type (OCaml 5.5 + the MMTk collector).
Of the 31 non-infer programs all build and 27 run cleanly under both native plans
(Immix, StickyImmix); `infer` has been validated on stock 5.4.0 + 5.5.0 but **not**
yet under MMTk (its `--multicore` shared-heap parallelism is untested there). Known
MMTk-only issues:

- **Crashes (4 programs).** `alt_ergo_{fill,yyll,unsat_smt2}` SIGSEGV (the moving
  collector relocates a value a C stub holds a raw pointer to, via zarith→GMP; runs
  fine under a non-moving MMTk build, so it's a moving-GC / object-pinning gap) and
  `pplacer_testsuite` SIGABRT (a channel finaliser locks an already-closed channel
  mutex during GC). Both are excluded from the running-ng MMTk configs.
- **Off-heap is not GC-paced.** `MMTK_HEAP_SIZE_MB` bounds only on-heap memory.
  Custom-block off-heap data (Bigarray bulk data in `owl_gc`, GMP limbs in
  `zarith_pi`) is freed by the block's finaliser only when the proxy is collected,
  but MMTk paces on on-heap occupancy, so off-heap bytes accumulate with the heap
  budget: `owl_gc` RSS goes from ~130 MB at a 3 MB heap to ~12 GB at a 16 GB heap
  with the same live set. Stock OCaml paces the major GC on off-heap memory via
  `caml_alloc_custom_mem`; under MMTk that path is currently inert. These benches
  are poor footprint signals under MMTk.

## Runtime-feature coverage matrix

Tags are assigned from **source-grounded** inspection of each benchmark's hot path
(read the driver `.ml`, `grep` the vendored tool for actual uses). We do not trust
upstream feature lists, only what is reachable from the workload we run. A tag whose
hot-path set is empty is a **coverage gap** (listed below). running-ng exposes these
through a `RUNNING_TAG` selector.

| Tag | Runtime mechanism | hot-path benchmarks | cold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **minor-gc** | `caml_alloc_small` fast path, young-ptr bump | coqc_corelib_stress, menhir_*, alt_ergo_*, zarith_pi, sedlex_tokenize, devkit_{network,htmlstream,stre}, cpdf_*, ydump_repeat, liq_parse_typecheck, ocamlc_self_compile, jsoo, ocamlformat_rocq, goblint | — |

| **`Bigarray` allocation** | `caml_ba_alloc` (custom block + off-heap bytes) | owl_gc (dim×dim Float64 Array2; input size `OWL_MATRIX_DIM` scales it 100→2400, RSS 26MB→4.77GB), liq_video_frames_pool (1280×720 YUV420), test_decompress (Bigstringaf), ocamlc_self_compile (`emitcode.ml:53` emit buffer) | — |
| **off-heap accounting / `custom_major_ratio` (M)** | `caml_alloc_custom_mem` → pacer | liq_video_frames_pool (the only bench whose wall+RSS Pareto front moves with M — the #14533 repro); owl_gc_{large,huge} (dim 1500/2400 → 18/46 MB Bigarrays, big enough to move the pacer — the input-size ladder now reaches this regime) | owl_gc (dim 100, ~80 KB blocks), zarith_pi, test_decompress (custom blocks too small to swing pacer policy) |

| **`Atomic.*` (hot)** | `caml_atomic_*` | eio_fiber_stream (`sem_state.ml`, `lazy.ml`) | lavyek_kv_*d (disabled), merlin_bench (disabled); ocaml-re does Atomic only at regex compile time, so devkit_* see it only in init |

| **io_uring (real syscalls)** | `Uring.t` via `eio_linux` | — (**gap**: only lavyek_kv_*d, disabled) | lavyek_kv_*d when re-enabled; eio_fiber_stream is pure in-memory (no io_uring) |
| **CPU pinning** | `pthread_setaffinity_np` via `ocaml-processor` | — (**gap**: only lavyek_kv_*d, disabled) | lavyek_kv_*d (`lavyek_bench.ml:59`) when re-enabled |

| `cpdf_{merge,blacktext,scale,squeeze}` | hashtbl (object map), bytes mutation, minor-gc; camlpdf C stubs (flate/zlib, AES, SHA-2) hit when decoding/re-compressing streams (squeeze), otherwise pure OCaml |
| `cpdf_squeeze_{small,default,large}` | input size = document working set (merge N=8/24/64 copies + recompress). Live PDF object map grows ~linearly with N (top_heap 110→405M w, RSS 0.88→3.0GB, majorGC 38→56); gc% FALLS 31→16% as flate C recompression dominates. Live-heap ladder, not a GC-pacing one |
| `alt_ergo_fill, alt_ergo_yyll` | weak-refs (Weak.Make hash-consing), hashtbl, format |
| `alt_ergo_chain_{small,default,large}` | input size = single-solve problem size (generated chain VC a(0)=0, a(i)=a(i-1)+1, prove a(N)=N; N=4000/7000/10500). One large mostly-live congruence structure per solve: top_heap 76→638M w, RSS 0.6→4.9GB, minor 3.7k→25k (major only 16→24, promo ~0.1). gc% RISES 14→26%, pauses grow (p99.9 3→22ms) — heap-scan-bound. Distinct from fill_x100's fixed-input repetition |
| `alt_ergo_unsat_smt2` | weak-refs, hashtbl, format, signals (SIGVTALRM armed by `--timelimit 15`) |
| `frama_c_eva_{t,sqlite,sqlite_small,sqlite_default,sqlite_large}` | weak-refs / ephemeron-backed hash-consing (Weak.Make at scale), hashtbl, recursive-variants (CIL AST), minor-gc, max-rss (sqlite, #11733). input-size ladder = `-eva-precision` (2nd wrapper arg) on sqlite; slevel inert; t is a fixed fast standalone |
| `goblint` | high allocation / minor-gc churn (~1.3GB for a 5.6KB input), hash-consing, apron relational domains (C/GMP FFI), recursive-variants (CIL AST), allocated-bytes (#13733) |
| `goblint_gen_{small,default,large}` | input size = analysed-program size (synthetic Btor2C bit-vector state machine, N=100/165/240 state vars; goblint.build.sh generates the .c). Pure allocation-churn ladder (#13733 signature): allocated_words 3.8→39.5G (10×), minor GC 15k→151k, gc% 22→34%; live set grows too (top_heap 5.9→19.5M, major 41→97) but RSS modest 77→186MB. octagon O(N²) → super-linear wall. Read by allocated_words. On-heap counterpoint to pplacer's off-heap footprint |
| `menhir_{sysver,ocamly,sysver_canonical,sql_parser}` | hashtbl, format, lazy, minor-gc; input-size ladder (automaton scale) = small sysver--table / default ocaml--canonical / large sysver--canonical--table, monotone by wall 7.8→13→87s AND RSS 0.72→2.76→4.0GB. sql_parser (LALR 1.2s) = fast extra, not a rung. Single-run (menhir has no loopable main) |
| `ocamlc_self_compile` | hashtbl, marshal (`.cmi`+`.cmo` writeout), bigarray (emit buffer), minor-gc |
| `ocamlc_compile_uucp{,_small,_default,_large}` | Compiler tool's size ladder = compiling N replicas of uucp (prefix-renamed Uucp→UucpK). uucp's COLLECTED heap → RSS flat ~87-115MB while major-GC scales (N=3/8/25 → major 376/771/1581, promo 0.14/0.40/1.36G w, 6/17/58s). gc% ~17% flat, pauses ~2-4ms. Major-GC-throughput ladder (vs self_compile's monotonic-heap memory-bound). build.sh stages a renamed ocamlc (`..._bin`) for olly attach (like self_compile) |
| `jsoo{,_small,_default,_large}` | hashtbl, lazy, marshal(cold); input size = input bytecode size (rung arg → generated per-runtime .byte from real JSOO sources × R replicas) → whole-program-IR footprint ladder (RSS 0.5→7.8GB), constant ~33% gc% + 129ms max pause @ large |
| `infer_{small,default,large}` | multi-domain shared-heap GC (`--multicore`, `INFER_JOBS` domains), minor-gc + major-promotion (allocation-heavy abstract interpretation), hashtbl (hashconsed type env), marshal (summary tables in/out of the SQLite capture DB); input-size ladder = roots-subset size (72/215/542 classes → warm ~9/16/44s at -j12), flat capture footprint; tags doc-grounded — hot-path source audit pending |

## Coverage gaps — verified

A regression in any of these areas would **not** be caught by the current suite.
Each was checked by `grep -rn` against the actual vendored source.

- **Multi-domain parallelism (`Domain.spawn`/`join`), real io_uring syscall traffic,
  and per-domain CPU pinning** — narrowed by infer, but not closed. `infer --multicore`
  now drives N>2 domains sharing one heap (its whole reason for existing here — the
  shared-heap GC under a real allocation-heavy analysis is the signal), so multi-domain
  parallelism is no longer a total gap. Still uncovered: real io_uring syscall traffic
  and per-domain CPU pinning (only `lavyek_kv_*`, private/disabled, ever drove those),
  and Domainslib work-stealing specifically (infer's scheduler is not yet source-audited
  for whether it uses `Domainslib.Task` or a hand-rolled pool). `eio_fiber_stream` still
  covers single-domain effects/fibers/Atomic. Re-enabling lavyek or importing a Sandmark
  `parallel_*` benchmark would close the io_uring/pinning/work-stealing remainder.
- **Ephemeron data-field semantics** — verified gap, narrowed. `runtime/weak.c` routes
  `caml_weak_*` through `caml_ephe_*` (a weak array is an ephemeron with no data field),
  so the ephemeron machinery (alloc, per-domain list, `caml_ephe_clean` key-scan) is
  covered on the hot path by the `Weak.Make` workloads: `frama_c_eva_sqlite`, `alt_ergo_*`,
  and now `goblint`. What remains uncovered is only the data-field path (`Ephemeron.K1`
  with data, `caml_ephe_set_data`/`get_data` + the data-clearing branch). No bench sets
  an ephemeron data field hot.
- **kcas / lock-free MCAS** — verified gap. Even when lavyek was enabled it didn't call
  kcas (`REMOVED.md:22`). A small standalone benchmark wrapping `kcas` would close it.
- **Domainslib work-stealing pools** — uncovered (eio uses fibers; lavyek dispatched via
  a manual `Atomic.fetch_and_add` counter).
- **`Gc.compact` / `Gc.full_major` in a hot loop** — no benchmark forces a full GC.
- **`Gc.alarm` / `Gc.create_alarm`** — no benchmark registers one.
- **High-frequency signal delivery in tight loops** — alt-ergo registers handlers but
  they fire at most once per run.
- **Pure-OCaml hot inner-loop float (flambda)** — owl_gc defers to OpenBLAS, so flambda
  has nothing to optimise in the inner loop. A pure-OCaml numerical kernel would catch it.
- **`Bigarray` slicing / reshape patterns** — owl_gc doesn't slice; liq_video_frames_pool
  fills planes without slicing.
- **Polling-points / safe-point density** — nothing stresses cooperative cancellation.
- **Direct user `Effect` handlers (outside Eio)** — every effect-perform goes through Eio.

If a runtime change touches one of these areas, flag the gap explicitly when proposing it.

## Vendored source patches

Applied automatically by `scripts/setup-monorepo.sh`.

| # | Target | What | Why |
|---|--------|------|-----|
| 1 | `duniverse/alt-ergo/.../theories.ml` | Fix ppx_blob paths | ppx_blob resolves from workspace root |
| 2 | `duniverse/alt-ergo/.../text/dune` | Rewrite dune file | Remove public_name/package (vendored exec) |
| 3 | `duniverse/dune_/dune-project` | `3.22` → `3.21`, rm test/ | dune 3.22 features not in installed dune |
| 4 | `duniverse/ppxlib/` | Replace with a pinned commit (`sources.yml`) | Adds Ast_506 for OCaml 5.6 trunk |
| 5 | `duniverse/lwt/` | Replace with a pinned commit (`sources.yml`) | Fixes socketaddr.h for OCaml 5.6 |
| 6 | `duniverse/devkit/lwt_engines.ml` | Add `engine_id` type + method | lwt 6.1.1 added virtual `id` method |
| 7 | `vendor/libevent/libevent.ml` | Add `~persist`, `~signal` labels | OCaml 5.x strict label matching |
| 8 | `duniverse/js_of_ocaml/.../dune` | Remove `public_name`/`package` from the executable stanza | Vendored executable. Match on **content, not line number**: upstream reordered these fields (`public_name` moved from line 2 to line 3) and the old line-anchored `sed` silently became a no-op that still logged success |
| 9 | `duniverse/ocamlformat/.../dune` | Remove public_name | Vendored executable |
| 10 | `duniverse/owl/.../exponpow.c` | Fix `std_gaussian_rvs` calls | Upstream C bug: function takes no args |
| 11 | `duniverse/batteries-included/.../batGc.mli` | Add `live_stacks_words` field | OCaml 5.6 added field to `Gc.stat` |
| 12 | `vendor/pplacer/mcl/caml/caml_mcl.c` | Add `#include <stdint.h>` | OCaml 5.6 trunk headers need it |
| 13 | `vendor/pplacer/tests/tests.ml` | Add `PPLACER_TEST_LOOP` env-var loop | Run the suite N times in one process (see Iteration counts) |
| 14 | `duniverse/analyzer/.../runtime/include/goblint.h` | `__goblint_assume_join` arg type | GCC 14+/C23 conflicting-types vs the `.c` definition |
| 15 | `duniverse/cpu/` | Run `autoconf; autoheader; ./configure` **with `$TOOLS_BIN` on `PATH`** | Generates `src/config.h` its C stub needs (opam runs this; dune doesn't). `./configure` probes for `ocamlc` and aborts with "You must install the OCaml compiler" without one, and this patch section runs *before* step [8] puts `$TOOLS_BIN` on `PATH` — so it must set it itself. Failure is fatal: it used to be a swallowed warning, and the only symptom was goblint failing much later with `cpu_stubs.c:1:10: fatal error: config.h: No such file or directory` |
| 16 | `duniverse/json-data-encoding/.../json_repr.{ml,mli}` | Add `` `Tuple ``/`` `Variant `` to `Json_repr.Yojson` | dune-universe fork narrows the type; goblint treats it as `Yojson.Safe.t` both ways |
| 17 | `duniverse/bare-ocaml/src/dune` | Install `Bare_encoding.ml`/`.mli` | catapult copies them via `%{lib:bare_encoding:…}` (needs source installed) |
| 18 | `duniverse/analyzer/.../control.ml` | Annotate `(module CFG : CfgBidirSkip)` | OCaml ≥ 5.5 can't infer the packaged-module signature otherwise |
| 19 | `duniverse/rocq/dune-project` + `dune` | Drop `(using coq 0.8)` and the `dev`-profile `(coq (flags ...))` | dune 3.24 deleted the `coq` extension. It's a *parse* error, so it broke **every** build in the workspace, not just rocq's. Both declarations are dead here (rocq generates its theory rules via `tools/dune_rule_gen`; the only stanzas needing the extension are in `dune.disabled` files), so they're removed rather than ported to `(using rocq ...)` |
| 20 | `duniverse/rocq/toplevel/dune` | Collapse the `(select memtrace_init.ml …)` to its `(-> memtrace_init.default.ml)` default clause | rocq-runtime has an *optional* memtrace integration (`(select)` + `depopts: memtrace`). dune auto-enables it the moment `memtrace` is present anywhere in the workspace — which it is once a benchmark vendors memtrace — so `rocq-runtime.toplevel` gains `requires memtrace` in its generated META. The rocq bootstrap's `gen_rules.exe` resolves that library through findlib on `$OCAMLPATH`, where the vendored memtrace is never installed, and dies with `findlib error: memtrace not found … required by rocq-runtime.toplevel`. Forcing the default (memtrace-free) clause keeps rocq's toplevel from ever linking/requiring memtrace, independent of any benchmark vendoring it |
| 23 | `vendor/camlpdf/pdftree.ml` | Drop the duplicate name/number tree key warning | `cpdf_squeeze` merges N copies of one PDF, so every key collides; camlpdf logged ~13M flushed stderr lines per `_large` invocation (~830 MB of log, and stderr I/O inside the measured region). Dedup behaviour unchanged; other `Pdfe` diagnostics still print |

## Known limitations

- **Rocq symlink**: setup creates a symlink at
  `<parent_of_monorepo>/install/default/lib/rocq-runtime` pointing at `_rocq_prefix/`,
  because dune's generated `.vo` rules use relative paths that resolve outside the
  monorepo. `make clean-all` removes it.
- **melange**: parked. Needs the `(using melange 0.1)` dune extension; can't benchmark
  standalone.
- **Frama-C / dune-site**: EVA is linked statically (`-linkall`) and run with
  `-no-autoload-plugins`, so dune-site plugin discovery is never used (the `.cmxs` path
  doesn't work for a relocated, uninstalled build). Its resource sites are empty in an
  uninstalled build, so `frama-c.build.sh` sets `DUNE_DIR_LOCATIONS` at `vendor/frama-c`.
  WP is excluded (its `why3` dep caps OCaml < 5.5); EVA needs neither.
- **goblint / apron**: apron is non-dune (configure/make + camlidl), so it can't join the
  unified dune build. `scripts/vendor-apron.sh` builds the camlidl/mlgmpidl/apron chain
  per-runtime from pinned source into a self-contained prefix (opam-free: active compiler
  + gcc + ocamlfind + make), and `goblint.build.sh` exposes it via `OCAMLPATH`. Runtime
  stubs are found via `pre.custom_includes` since dune-site sites aren't populated in an
  uninstalled build. On trunk goblint builds from `fb4f451` onward (the late-May
  `cfb30145` snapshot hit a since-fixed `Ctype.Unify` compiler bug).
- **OxCaml**: only menhir, test_decompress, and zarith_pi work; others fail on
  locality-type annotation errors in vendored packages.
- **Trunk (5.6) support**: depends on ppxlib and lwt git main (patches 4+5). When ppxlib
  releases a 5.6-compatible version, these can be dropped and the lock file updated.
- **pplacer**: vendored manually (not in opam); needs `libgsl-dev` and `libsqlite3-dev`.
- **frama-c**: vendored manually (`scripts/vendor-frama-c.sh`); 32.1 isn't in opam and only
  a trimmed kernel+EVA is built. Needs `libyaml`/`pkg-config` and a C preprocessor. The
  vendor script fills Frama-C's empty `*.opam` placeholders so opam-monorepo can scan.

## Updating dependencies

For a third-party source that is **not** in the lock file (the git pins and the
tarballs — ppxlib, lwt, js_of_ocaml, pplacer, mcl, frama-c, the apron chain, cpdf,
menhir, rocq, alt-ergo's deps, …), the bump is a one-line edit to `sources.yml`
followed by `make setup`. Nothing else references the version.

For the lock file itself:

```bash
# 1. Modify dune-project if adding/removing packages
# 2. Re-lock in a switch that has the opam-monorepo plugin
#    (OPAMSWITCH selects it for this one command without changing your shell's switch)
OPAMSWITCH=<tools-switch> opam monorepo lock
# 3. Rebuild from scratch
make clean-all && make setup
# 4. Commit the updated lock file
git add macro-benches.opam.locked dune-project *.opam
git commit -m "Update vendored dependencies"
```

## Adding a new benchmark

1. Add a `(package ...)` declaration in `dune-project`.
2. Create an `.opam.template` if non-dune deps need `x-opam-monorepo-opam-provided`.
3. Re-lock: `opam monorepo lock`.
4. Create `benchmarks/<tool>/` with `<tool>.build.sh`, a `dune` file (if custom `.ml`),
   and input files.
5. Add every program to `benchmarks/manifest.yml` **in the same commit** — CI fails
   if a build script has no program entry (or vice versa). For a input-size ladder, list
   only the `_small` rung. A tool that ships disabled goes under `disabled:` with a
   reason instead.
6. Register it in your orchestrator config (running-ng's experiment YAML), with the
   same `args` string as the manifest.
7. Add it to the test-build list in `scripts/setup-monorepo.sh`.
8. Add a human page at `docs/benchmarks/<tool>.md`.
9. Test: `make clean-all && make setup`, then
   `ONLY="<prog>" bash scripts/ci-build-all.sh && ONLY="<prog>" bash scripts/ci-run-all.sh`.

## Backlog

Follow-up benchmarking work carried over from the old `TODO.md`. Append entries with
date, owner if known, and enough context that someone else can pick it up. The
coverage-gaps section above is the current authority on what the suite misses; the
first entry here is the prioritised plan for closing those gaps.

### Close runtime-feature coverage gaps — filed 2026-05-15

A source-grounded audit of every benchmark against the runtime mechanisms it exercises
turned up ten mechanisms no benchmark exercises hot (see "Coverage gaps" above). The
running-ng `RUNNING_TAG=ephemerons` and `RUNNING_TAG=kcas` selectors already error
loudly when invoked, which keeps those two discoverable; the rest live only in docs.

Since filing, frama-c and goblint landed and cover the **ephemeron machinery** on the
hot path via `Weak.Make`, so gap #1 has narrowed to the ephemeron **data-field** path
only. The remaining gaps and candidate closures:

- Ephemeron data-field (`Ephemeron.K1.Hashtbl`): small dedicated benchmark, ~100-200 lines.
- kcas / lock-free MCAS: standalone benchmark wrapping `Kcas_data.Hashtbl`/`Queue` under
  N-domain contention, ~150 lines; can vendor as a sibling to lavyek.
- Domainslib work-stealing: Sandmark `parallel_binarytrees` import (~200 lines).
- Forced `Gc.compact`/`Gc.full_major`: a `_compact` variant wrapping an existing
  allocation-heavy driver (compaction-vs-finalisers is the interesting story for owl_gc
  and liq_video_frames_pool).
- `Gc.alarm` callbacks: synthetic ~50-line driver.
- High-frequency `Sys.set_signal`: itimer-driven SIGALRM at ~1ms combined with an
  allocator-heavy driver.
- Pure-OCaml flambda-sensitive float kernel: Sandmark `nbody`/`raytracer`/`mandelbrot`
  import (~200 lines each; `nbody` is the canonical flambda one).
- `Bigarray` slicing/reshape: a `Genarray.slice_left`/`Array1.sub` micro-stressor, or
  fork owl_gc to slice-based access.
- Polling-points / safe-point density: tight no-alloc loop under an `Eio.Switch` with
  periodic cancellation pokes.
- Direct user `Effect.Deep.try_with` outside Eio: Sandmark `effects` microbench (~80 lines).

Suggested order, cheapest signal first: `Gc.alarm` synthetic → `Gc.compact` variant →
Sandmark `nbody` → ephemeron data-field synthetic → kcas synthetic → Sandmark
`parallel_binarytrees`. Status: not started.

### Investigate `ocamlc_self_compile` allocation regression on d8b — filed 2026-05-06

`ocamlc_self_compile` regresses ~+8% wall on d8bb46c across all flag combos but only drops
~5% RSS, unlike sibling RSS-winners (cpdf_*, menhir_sysver) that drop 20-40% RSS. On the
2026-05-03 monolith N=3 run, d8b allocates ~1.3 GB more minor-heap bytes for the same
deterministic compile (8.57 → 9.90 GB total, minor collections +15.6%, major −25%, RSS
−4.9%). By contrast cpdf_merge's total allocation is identical across versions and only RSS
moves (the canonical pacer story). So this is the workload allocating differently between
versions, not the pacer.

The old ephemeron hypothesis was **invalidated 2026-05-15**: `grep -rn Ephemeron typing/
bytecomp/ driver/ utils/` returns nothing in 5.4.1 and trunk; `btype.ml:46` uses
`Hashtbl.Make`. Leading hypotheses now: stdlib growth (more modules to typecheck per
compile), `Hashtbl` resize/per-entry overhead in `TypeHash`, `Marshal`/`Compression`
buffer behaviour for `.cmi`/`.cmo`, or the `Bigarray.Array1` emit-buffer growth policy.
Next steps: `OCAMLRUNPARAM=v=0x400` per-cycle GC log to see when the extra allocation lands;
reduce the workload to one module to test per-node vs fixed offset; statmemprof diff; bisect
5.4 → d8b. Status: not started.

### Domainslib / work-stealing N-domain benchmark — filed 2026-05-01, updated 2026-05-15

Lavyek (when enabled) provided N>2 domain shared-heap GC under contention plus io_uring, so
the remaining gap is specifically **work-stealing scheduler load**: nothing consumes
`Domainslib.Task.{run,parallel_for,async}`. Options: Sandmark `parallel_binarytrees` import
(preferred, ~200 lines, established shape), a synthetic tree-of-tasks driver under
`Domainslib.Task` (~150 lines), or Meta's `infer` (largest; open questions on
opam/dune-buildability and work-distribution pattern). Status: open; overlaps the
coverage-gaps entry.

### Re-enable `merlin_bench` once the upstream race is fixed — filed 2026-05-01

`merlin_bench` is vendored from the merlin-domains branch (PR #1890) and is the only
2-domain steady-state workload (main + typer worker). It's disabled: the typer-domain
handoff has a non-deterministic race that fires `Types.rev_log → Invalid -> assert false`
at N≥2 iterations on both 5.4.1 and d8bb46c. Full repro in
`benchmarks/merlin/UPSTREAM_BUG.md`. When picking up: watch PR #1890, re-vendor, flip the
programs list back on in running-ng, and re-validate (7 cram queries, ~16s at arg=4, ~1 GB
RSS, ~24% gc_overhead). Re-enabling moves `domains`/`effects`/`atomics` tags from cold to
exercised. Status: waiting on upstream fix.

### GC-parameter sweep on `liq_video_frames_pool` and related — filed 2026-05-01

Steps 1-2 resolved 2026-05-14: on the real liquidsoap pipeline (Ryzen 9 9950X), `M=250`
trades +10% RSS for −17% CPU, the predicted #14533 free-lunch shape in the large-M regime
(repro in the `offheap_M_o_sweep_2026_05_13.yml` results). Still pending: extend the sweep
to one bench per allocation-profile bucket (owl_gc, zarith_pi, liq_parse_typecheck,
ocamlc_self_compile — the last re-characterised 2026-05-15 as minor-heavy Hashtbl + Marshal
+ Bigarray, not ephemeron), then re-run the 8-variant cross-runtime comparison with each
bench at its per-runtime optimal `(s, o)` to see whether the apparent `zarith_pi` (16%) and
`ocamlc_self_compile` (10%) regressions shrink. Tooling: the `gc_sweep_all_versions.yml` and
`offheap_M_o_sweep_*.yml` running-ng configs. Status: steps 3-4 pending.

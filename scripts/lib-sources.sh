# lib-sources.sh — read pinned versions from sources.yml and clone git sources at
# their pinned commit. Source this file; don't execute it.
#
# Why: six vendored git sources (ppxlib, lwt, merlin, js_of_ocaml, pplacer, mcl)
# used to be cloned at a *branch HEAD*, so a cold `make setup` picked up whatever
# upstream happened to have that day — silently changing the vendored sources, the
# benchmark binaries built from them, and therefore the measurements. Two of them
# had already drifted from the validated tree by the time this was written (ppxlib
# by 7 weeks, lwt by 3 months), and one branch had been deleted upstream
# altogether, which broke a cold setup outright.
#
# Bumping a pin is now a one-line edit to sources.yml: it shows up in review, and
# CI rebuilds and re-runs everything against it. That is the whole point.

# Shell helpers that behave the same on GNU and BSD userland (sed_i, checksum,
# ncpu and friends). Sourced here so every vendor-*.sh gets them, since they all
# source this file; setup-monorepo.sh does too.

# A pin copied out of `git ls-remote` can name an *annotated tag object* rather
# than the commit it points at: ls-remote prints the tag object for
# `refs/tags/<t>` and the commit only for the `refs/tags/<t>^{}` line. Checking
# such a pin out lands on the commit, so a literal compare against the pin fails
# even though the tree is exactly the pinned one. Peel before comparing.
#
# Falls back to printing <sha> unchanged when the object is not in <dir> (no
# checkout yet, or a genuinely wrong sha), so a real mismatch still fails loudly
# instead of silently passing.

# how you find out what you actually have (`git -C <dir> rev-parse HEAD`) and how
# this function decides whether to re-clone. The old scripts deleted it, which is
# why recovering the pins in the first place meant reverse-engineering tree hashes.

# setup-monorepo.sh — Full setup of the macro-benches monorepo.
#
# Populates duniverse/ and vendor/, applies all required patches, generates
# rocq's config + dunestrap files, and runs a test build of all benchmarks.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - opam 2.3+ available (at /usr/local/bin/opam or on PATH)
#   - An opam switch with dune + ocamlfind (default: "running-ng-tools")
#   - System packages: libgmp-dev, libevent-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev,
#                      libpcre3-dev, zlib1g-dev
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/setup-monorepo.sh
#
# After setup, run benchmarks standalone: build any benchmark and run its binary
# (e.g. `bash benchmarks/eio/eio.build.sh && ./benchmarks/eio/eio-<runtime>`), or
# `bash scripts/ci-build-all.sh && bash scripts/ci-run-all.sh` to build + smoke-run.
# For cross-runtime / GC-parameter sweeps, plug in an orchestrator (running-ng is
# one option) with RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR=~/macro-benches pointing it here.

# memtrace is never installed -- so gen_rules dies with:

# We don't want rocq's own memtrace profiling here, so collapse the select to its

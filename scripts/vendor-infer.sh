# vendor-infer.sh — clone Infer source into vendor/infer for a java-only,
# pure-dune macro-benchmark build.
#
# WHY MANUAL VENDORING (like frama-c / pplacer, not opam-monorepo):
# Infer's upstream build is autoconf + make that *generates* its dune files
# from *.in templates (substituting a handful of @BUILD_*_ANALYZERS@ /
# @BUILD_PLATFORM@ booleans) and its ./configure ASSERTS that many OCaml
# packages are already installed (atdgen, javalib, sawja, yojson, ...) and
# probes for external tools (javac, menhir, atdgen).  In the monorepo those
# deps live in duniverse/, not the tools switch, so running ./configure at
# setup would fail.  Instead we:
#   1. clone the source at a pinned ref,
#   2. drop the top-level dune-workspace (the monorepo provides the single
#      workspace/context) but KEEP infer/dune-project so vendor/infer is a
#      self-contained dune project pinning `(lang dune 3.16)` + menhir 3.0,
#   3. neutralize every *.opam in the tree so opam-monorepo does not treat
#      Infer as a local package and try to vendor its (already-declared)
#      deps a second time — the real deps are declared in dune-project's
#      `macro-bench-infer` package,
#   4. lay down a committed set of pre-generated *java-only* dune files
#      (dune-overlays/infer/) — the exact files `./configure && make`
#      produces for a java-only tree, with @BUILD_PLATFORM@ pinned to Linux
#      (darwin=false => -O3 flambda, identical across runtimes).
#
# Regenerating the overlay (only when bumping INFER_REF): configure an Infer
# checkout java-only (./build-infer.sh java) and copy the generated
# infer/src/{dune,dune.common,unit/dune,integration/dune,integration/unit/dune,
# java/dune,opensource/dune} and infer/src/base/Version.ml into
# dune-overlays/infer/, then set `let darwin = false` in dune.common.
#
# The benchmark exe is built by benchmarks/infer/infer.build.sh as
#   dune build vendor/infer/infer/src/infer.exe
set -euo pipefail

# Pinned source: the java-only, OCaml 5.2–5.4 tree, tagged `inferbench-v1.1`.
# Pinned to an immutable release tag (not a branch name) so the benchmark
# source can't shift under us if development branches are later updated.

# ~13M lines per invocation: ~780 MB of benchmark log AND a multi-GB `logs` file
# inside the capture dir (one sweep accumulated 31 GB across four runtimes and
# filled the host's disk), plus the write I/O inside the measured region.

# Skip both log calls when the bar is `Quiet` (what --no-progress-bar sets);
# every other style keeps upstream behaviour, and `f ()` still runs either way.

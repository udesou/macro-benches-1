# macro-benches

A suite of real-world OCaml programs used as macro-benchmarks, for comparing
one OCaml runtime against another on workloads that look like the things people
actually run: compilers, provers, static analysers, a video pipeline, a
key-value store, and so on.

Every dependency is vendored into the repo with
[opam-monorepo](https://github.com/tarides/opam-monorepo), so every runtime
compiles byte-identical source. The only thing that changes between runs is the
compiler, which is the whole point: if a number moves, it is the runtime that
moved it, not a different version of some library that happened to get pulled
in.

You can use it two ways:

- **Standalone.** Run `make setup` once, then build any single benchmark under
  any opam switch and run the binary yourself.
- **Orchestrated.** Point an orchestrator such as
  [running-ng](https://github.com/udesou/running-ng) at the repo and let it
  manage per-runtime switches and drive cross-runtime, frame-pointer, flambda,
  or GC-parameter sweeps.

## The benchmarks

23 tools (21 active; `merlin` and `lavyek` disabled — see below). Each active
tool has an **input-size ladder**: `small` / `default` / `large` (a couple also
`huge`) rungs whose input is chosen so each reaches a different GC/runtime
regime, not just a bigger copy of the one below. A bare run
executes the `default` rung of every tool; other sizes are opt-in via a tag (see
[Run sweeps](#run-sweeps)). Older single-point benchmarks with original anchors,
extra per-tool workloads, and the frozen issue reproducers are kept as
**legacy** benches, run only with `RUNNING_TAG=legacy`.

Two more tools ship in the tree but are currently disabled:
[merlin](docs/benchmarks/merlin.md) (an upstream race in the domains typer) and
[lavyek](docs/benchmarks/lavyek.md) (it lives in a private repo). Their pages
explain the details and what coverage they would add back.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake m4 pkg-config zip \
                 libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libevent-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
                 libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libopenblas-dev liblapacke-dev \
                 libgsl-dev libsqlite3-dev libyaml-dev
```

On FreeBSD, as root:

```sh
pkg install autoconf automake libtool m4 pkgconf gmake zip \
            gmp mpfr openblas lapacke gsl sqlite3 libyaml perl5 \
            curl libev libevent pcre
```

`make setup` puts `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib` on the C
toolchain's search path for you (`scripts/lib-portable.sh`). You need this
because FreeBSD's base clang searches **neither**: its default list is only
`/usr/lib/clang/<v>/include` and `/usr/include`, so a vendored C stub that
includes a pkg-installed header fails with `fatal error: 'gsl/gsl_vector.h'
file not found` even though the package is installed. Set `LOCALBASE` if your
packages are somewhere other than `/usr/local`. Building a benchmark by hand,
outside `make setup`, may need the same:

```sh
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

Two differences from the apt list, both deliberate:

* **No zlib, and no C toolchain.** FreeBSD ships both in the base system, so
  there is nothing to install. `gmake` is listed separately because a few
  vendored `configure` scripts generate GNU-only makefiles.
* **No PCRE2.** Neither list needs it. `conf-libpcre2-8` used to sit in
  `macro-bench-devkit.opam.template`, but nothing in the tree has ever used
  PCRE2: devkit depends on the `pcre` OCaml library (PCRE **1**, via
  `conf-libpcre`), there is no `Pcre2.` anywhere under `duniverse/`, and the
  apt list only ever installed `libpcre3-dev`. On CI the requirement was
  satisfied by accident, because `libgio-2.0-dev` and `libselinux1-dev` drag
  `libpcre2-dev` in. It has been dropped from the template and the lock.

Four suites need a source patch on FreeBSD, all applied by `make setup`:
**devkit** (patch 25, below), **owl** (patch 26: OpenMP link flags, since
`-fopenmp` can arrive from `pkg-config openblas` while nothing adds `-lomp`),
**pplacer** (patch 27: `gsl-ocaml`'s discover hardcodes `/usr/include`, and
pkgconf strips `-I/usr/local/include` from its output so the hardcoded default
is what gets used), and **goblint**, whose apron chain needs GNU make because
camlidl's Makefile uses GNU conditionals that bmake rejects as a syntax error
(`scripts/vendor-apron.sh` now calls `gmake` where available).

On devkit specifically: it calls `U.gettid ()`, where `U = ExtUnix.Specific`, and
`ExtUnix.Specific` exposes only what the platform actually has. extunix already
implements `gettid` four ways, but its `discover.ml` probe matches none of them
on FreeBSD purely on spelling: FreeBSD calls it `pthread_getthreadid_np()` in
`<pthread_np.h>` where macOS calls it `pthread_threadid_np()`. Without the
patch `duniverse/devkit` fails to compile with `Unbound value U.gettid`, taking
`benchmarks/ahrefs-devkit` with it. Patch 25 adds the missing probe
alternative; Linux is unaffected, since `pthread_np.h` does not exist there and
the probe still falls through to `SYS_gettid`.

This is the same list CI installs, so it is the one that is actually exercised on
a clean machine. `zip` is a plain command-line tool rather than a library, needed by
`scripts/vendor-infer-corpus.sh`; without it infer's corpus step fails with
`zip: command not found`. It was missing from this list until a FreeBSD run
hit it, so a minimal Linux image can hit it too.

Notably `liblapacke-dev` is separate from `libopenblas-dev` —
owl links `-llapacke`, and without it the build fails at link time with
`/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llapacke`.

You also need opam 2.3+ and a switch with `dune` and `ocamlfind` (one is created
for you if needed).

### Setup

```bash
cd ~/macro-benches
make setup          # or: bash scripts/setup-monorepo.sh
```

This pulls the vendored packages, applies the source patches, builds the few
non-dune dependencies (pplacer, apron, rocq), and test-builds every binary. The
first run takes around ten minutes; later runs skip the steps that are already
done. It is idempotent, so you can rerun it any time without `make clean`.

#### dune compatibility

Verified with dune **3.22.1** and **3.24.0**.

dune 3.24 deleted the `coq` language extension ("The Coq Build Language has been
replaced by the Rocq Build Language"), and vendored rocq still declared
`(using coq 0.8)`. Because that is a *parse* error, it broke every build in the
workspace, not just rocq's — `dune build benchmarks/decompress/...` failed with
`Error: Extension coq was deleted in the 3.24 version of the dune language`.

Setup step 3b removes that declaration and the matching `(coq (flags ...))`
field from rocq's `dev` profile. Both are dead configuration here: no active
`dune` file under `duniverse/rocq` contains a `coq.theory` / `coq.pp` /
`coq.extraction` stanza, because rocq compiles its theories through its own
`tools/dune_rule_gen` (which emits plain `(rule (action (run rocq c ...)))`),
and the only files that would need the extension are two `dune.disabled` ones
that dune never reads. So the fix removes the declarations rather than porting
rocq to `(using rocq ...)`.

If you already have a populated `duniverse/`, rerun `make setup` to pick this
up — the step is skipped once applied.

### Run one benchmark by hand

Each benchmark has a build script that writes its binary to
`benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>-runtime`:

```bash
bash benchmarks/eio/eio.build.sh
./benchmarks/eio/eio-runtime
```

The build script assumes the compiler you want to measure is already on `PATH`
and writes its binary to `$RUNNING_OCAML_OUTPUT` (defaulting to
`<tool>-<runtime>` in the benchmark's own directory). See
[§Build-script contract](#build-script-contract).

Arguments matter — most benchmarks take an input file, an input size, or a rung
selector, so running a binary bare is a different benchmark from what the sweep
runs. Ask the manifest, which prints
*name, tool, script, timeout, expected exit, args*:

```bash
python3 scripts/ci-manifest.py list | grep -E '^(eio_conc_small|jsoo_small)\b'
```

The custom-`.ml` benchmarks can also be built straight from the dune workspace:

```bash
dune build -- benchmarks/eio/eio_bench.exe
./_build/default/benchmarks/eio/eio_bench.exe
```

### Run sweeps

For cross-runtime, frame-pointer, flambda, or GC-parameter sweeps you want an
orchestrator to manage the per-runtime switches. Point running-ng at the repo
(`export RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR=~/macro-benches`) and drive the sweeps from
there; see its docs for the available configs.

Which rungs run is selected by `RUNNING_TAG`:

| `RUNNING_TAG` | runs |
|---|---|
| *(unset)* | the `default` rung of every tool — the standard suite |
| `small_run` / `large_run` / `huge_run` | that size across every tool |
| `legacy` | the pre-ladder anchors, extra workloads, and frozen repros |
| `all_benches` | everything at once |

### Clean

```bash
make clean          # remove build artifacts, keep vendored sources
make clean-all      # remove everything generated (duniverse/, vendor/, _rocq_prefix/, _build*)
make setup          # repopulate from the lock file
```

### Build and run everything locally

The same two phases CI runs, driven off
[`benchmarks/manifest.yml`](benchmarks/manifest.yml) (the program list):

```bash
python3 scripts/ci-manifest.py check             # manifest vs. tree (seconds)
bash scripts/ci-build-all.sh                     # build every program (all rungs + legacy)
bash scripts/ci-run-all.sh                       # run the small rung of each tool once
ONLY="jsoo_small goblint_gen_small" bash scripts/ci-run-all.sh  # or just a few
```

CI builds everything (catching build breaks) but only *runs* the small rung of
each tool — flagged `ci_run: true` in the manifest — since the large rungs don't
fit a hosted runner.

When you add a benchmark, add it to the manifest in the same commit as its build
script — `check` fails if the two disagree, including when a new program is added
to a tool that already has a build script. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) §CI.

## How it works

1. Dependencies are locked once (`opam monorepo lock`) into
   `macro-benches.opam.locked`, which is committed.
2. `opam monorepo pull` downloads all of them into `duniverse/`. No solver, no
   `opam install`.
3. `setup-monorepo.sh` applies a handful of source patches for newer compilers
   and known upstream bugs. One of them keeps the workspace parseable by
   dune >= 3.24, which deleted the `coq` language extension that vendored rocq
   still declared — see "dune compatibility" below.
4. The few packages that aren't opam/dune (pplacer, apron, rocq) are vendored
   and built by their own scripts.
5. `dune build` compiles everything from local source with whichever compiler is
   on PATH, into a per-runtime `_build-<runtime>/` directory so different
   runtimes don't clobber each other.

## Build-script contract

A `benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>.build.sh` is called with the runtime's opam switch
already activated, so its compiler and `dune` are on `PATH`. It reads:

| Variable | Meaning | Fallback when unset |
|---|---|---|
| `RUNNING_OCAML_BENCH_DIR` | the benchmark's own directory (`benchmarks/<tool>/`) | the script's own directory |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_OUTPUT` | where to write the binary (absolute) | `<bench dir>/<tool>-<runtime>` |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_RUNTIME_NAME` | runtime tag, e.g. `ocaml-5.5.0` | `runtime` |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH` | the active opam switch | unset |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH_PREFIX` | that switch's prefix path | resolved from `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH`, else the `ocamlc` on `PATH` |

A script derives the monorepo root from its bench dir, builds into a per-runtime
`_build-<runtime>/`, and copies the result out. 

## Layout

```text
benchmarks/<tool>/   build script + input data (and driver .ml for custom benches)
docs/benchmarks/     one page per benchmark: what it runs and how to read it
scripts/             setup-monorepo.sh and the vendor-*.sh helpers
dune-overlays/       hand-written dune files for non-dune packages
duniverse/           vendored dependency sources          (generated, gitignored)
vendor/              manually vendored non-dune packages   (generated, gitignored)
macro-benches.opam.locked   the lock file                 (committed)
```

## More documentation

- [docs/benchmarks/](docs/benchmarks) has a page per benchmark.
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the operational detail beyond the build-script

  table, the runtime-feature coverage matrix and known gaps, the backlog, and
  the gotchas worth knowing before you touch the build.

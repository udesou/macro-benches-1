# macro-benches

A suite of real-world OCaml programs used as macro-benchmarks, for comparing
one OCaml runtime against another on workloads that look like the things people
actually run: compilers, provers, static analysers, a video pipeline, a
key-value store, and so on.

Every dependency is vendored into the repo with
[opam-monorepo](https://github.com/tarides/opam-monorepo), so every runtime
compiles byte-identical source. The only thing that changes between runs is the
compiler, which is the whole point: if a number moves, it is the runtime that
moved it, not a different version of some library that happened to get pulled
in.

You can use it two ways:

- **Standalone.** Run `make setup` once, then build any single benchmark under
  any opam switch and run the binary yourself.
- **Orchestrated.** Point an orchestrator such as
  [running-ng](https://github.com/udesou/running-ng) at the repo and let it
  manage per-runtime switches and drive cross-runtime, frame-pointer, flambda,
  or GC-parameter sweeps.

## The benchmarks

21 active tools, 32 programs. Most land in the 5-25s range that keeps a
benchmark long enough to measure and short enough to iterate on; a few of the
heavier compiler and proof workloads run longer, and goblint runs much shorter
(its interest is allocation volume, not wall time).

Each benchmark has its own page under [docs/benchmarks/](docs/benchmarks) with
what it runs, what it stresses in the runtime, and how to read its results.

Two more tools ship in the tree but are currently disabled:
[merlin](docs/benchmarks/merlin.md) (an upstream race in the domains typer) and
[lavyek](docs/benchmarks/lavyek.md) (it lives in a private repo). Their pages
explain the details and what coverage they would add back.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libevent-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
                 libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libopenblas-dev \
                 libgsl-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

You also need opam 2.3+ and a switch with `dune` and `ocamlfind` (one is created
for you if needed).

### Setup

```bash
cd ~/macro-benches
make setup          # or: bash scripts/setup-monorepo.sh
```

This pulls the vendored packages, applies the source patches, builds the few
non-dune dependencies (pplacer, apron, rocq), and test-builds every binary. The
first run takes around ten minutes; later runs skip the steps that are already
done. It is idempotent, so you can rerun it any time without `make clean`.

### Run one benchmark by hand

Each benchmark has a build script that writes its binary to
`benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>-runtime`:

```bash
bash benchmarks/eio/eio.build.sh
./benchmarks/eio/eio-runtime
```

The custom-`.ml` benchmarks can also be built straight from the dune workspace:

```bash
dune build -- benchmarks/eio/eio_bench.exe
./_build/default/benchmarks/eio/eio_bench.exe
```

### Run sweeps

For cross-runtime, frame-pointer, flambda, or GC-parameter sweeps you want an
orchestrator to manage the per-runtime switches. Point running-ng at the repo
(`export RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR=~/macro-benches`) and drive the sweeps from
there; see its docs for the available configs.

### Clean

```bash
make clean          # remove build artifacts, keep vendored sources
make clean-all      # remove everything generated (duniverse/, vendor/, _rocq_prefix/, _build*)
make setup          # repopulate from the lock file
```

## How it works

1. Dependencies are locked once (`opam monorepo lock`) into
   `macro-benches.opam.locked`, which is committed.
2. `opam monorepo pull` downloads all of them into `duniverse/`. No solver, no
   `opam install`.
3. `setup-monorepo.sh` applies a handful of source patches for newer compilers
   and known upstream bugs.
4. The few packages that aren't opam/dune (pplacer, apron, rocq) are vendored
   and built by their own scripts.
5. `dune build` compiles everything from local source with whichever compiler is
   on PATH, into a per-runtime `_build-<runtime>/` directory so different
   runtimes don't clobber each other.

## Layout

```text
benchmarks/<tool>/   build script + input data (and driver .ml for custom benches)
docs/benchmarks/     one page per benchmark: what it runs and how to read it
scripts/             setup-monorepo.sh and the vendor-*.sh helpers
dune-overlays/       hand-written dune files for non-dune packages
duniverse/           vendored dependency sources          (generated, gitignored)
vendor/              manually vendored non-dune packages   (generated, gitignored)
macro-benches.opam.locked   the lock file                 (committed)
```

## More documentation

- [docs/benchmarks/](docs/benchmarks) has a page per benchmark.
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the operational detail: the build-script contract,
  the in-process iteration and ring-size mechanics, the vendored-source patch
  table, the runtime-feature coverage matrix and known gaps, the backlog, and
  the gotchas worth knowing before you touch the build.

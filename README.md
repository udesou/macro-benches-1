# macro-benches

A suite of real-world OCaml programs used as macro-benchmarks, for comparing multiple OCaml runtimes
on real world workloads: compilers, provers, static analysers, etc.

Every dependency is vendored into the repo with
[opam-monorepo](https://github.com/tarides/opam-monorepo), so every runtime
compiles byte-identical source.

The benchmarks can be used in two ways:

- **Standalone.** Run `make setup` once, then build any single benchmark under any opam switch and run the binary yourself.
- **Orchestrated.** Point a benchmark orchestrator such as
  [running-ng](https://github.com/udesou/running-ng) at the repo and let it
  manage per-runtime switches and drive cross-runtime or
  GC-parameter sweeps.

## The benchmarks

21 active tools with each tool taking different inputs split in an **input-size ladder**: 
`small` / `default` / `large` step (a few `huge`) whose input is chosen so each step reaches a different GC/runtime regime.  A bare run executes the `default` step of every tool; 
other sizes are opt-in via a tag (see [Run sweeps](#run-sweeps)).

[lavyek](docs/benchmarks/lavyek.md) (it lives in a private repo). Their pages
explain the details and what coverage they would add back.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

opam 2.3+ and a switch with `dune` and `ocamlfind`, plus the system libraries below.

Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake m4 pkg-config zip python3-yaml \
                 libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libevent-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
                 libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libopenblas-dev liblapacke-dev \
                 libgsl-dev libsqlite3-dev libyaml-dev
```

FreeBSD (as root):

```sh
pkg install bash git python3 autoconf automake libtool m4 pkgconf gmake gcc zip \
            gmp mpfr openblas lapacke gsl sqlite3 libyaml perl5 \
            curl libev libevent pcre py311-pyyaml
```

You might also need to set (if not set already):

```sh
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

Also set `LOCALBASE` if your packages are somewhere other than `/usr/local`. Several
suites need a source patch on FreeBSD; `make setup` applies them all.

### Setup

```bash
cd ~/macro-benches
make setup          # or: bash scripts/setup-monorepo.sh
```

This pulls the vendored packages, applies the source patches, builds the few
non-dune dependencies (pplacer, apron, rocq), and test-builds every binary. 

Verified with dune **3.22.1** and **3.24.0**. If you already have a populated
`duniverse/` and are moving to dune 3.24+, rerun `make setup`.

### Run one benchmark by hand

Each benchmark has a build script that writes its binary to
`benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>-runtime`:

```bash
bash benchmarks/eio/eio.build.sh
./benchmarks/eio/eio-runtime
```

The build script assumes the compiler you want to measure is already on `PATH`
and writes its binary to `$RUNNING_OCAML_OUTPUT` (defaulting to
`<tool>-<runtime>` in the benchmark's own directory). See
[Build-script contract](#build-script-contract).

Most benchmarks take an input file, an input size, or a step
selector. To know a bit more more about each benchmark, you may ask the manifest using the program name from the table above, which prints *name, tool, script, timeout, expected exit, args*:

```bash
python3 scripts/ci-manifest.py list | grep -E '^(eio_conc_.*|jsoo_.*)\b'
```

The custom-`.ml` benchmarks can also be built straight from the dune workspace:

```bash
dune build -- benchmarks/eio/eio_bench.exe
./_build/default/benchmarks/eio/eio_bench.exe
```

### Run sweeps

For cross-runtime or doing GC-parameter sweeps you want an
orchestrator to manage the per-runtime switches. [running-ng](https://github.com/udesou/running-ng) can be used 
in combination with the macro-benchmarks by checking it out and defining `export RUNNING_MACRO_BENCH_DIR=~/macro-benches`. 
The set of scripts helps drive the benchmark runs. To know more about how to use running-ng see its own docs.

Benchmarks can be selected by `RUNNING_TAG`:

Two kinds: the input-size ladder, which picks a rung, and the runtime-feature
tags, which pick the programs that exercise one runtime mechanism. Tags combine
with commas (union), and the result is intersected with the config's
`benchmarks:` block.

| `RUNNING_TAG` | runs |
|---|---|
| *(unset)* / `default_run` | the `default` step of every tool, the standard suite (21) |
| `small_run` / `large_run` / `huge_run` | that size across every tool (`huge_run` exists only for zarith and owl) |
| `legacy` | the pre-ladder anchors, extra workloads, and frozen repros (30) |
| `all_benches` | everything at once (95) |

| feature tag | the mechanism, and which tools carry it |
|---|---|
| `weak_refs` | `Weak.Make` hash-consing: alt-ergo (theory terms), frama-c (EVA's state maps) |
| `ephemerons` | the ephemeron *data* field (`Ephemeron.K1` with a value), which `weak_refs` does not reach: coq, through rocq's `CEphemeron` on the bytecode VM's global-slot path |
| `effects` | `Effect.perform` and fiber switching: eio |
| `domains` | `Domain.spawn` / `join` / `DLS`, the pinning we patch in, and so also the parallel GC: infer (the only multi-domain tool while lavyek is disabled) |
| `marshal` | `caml_output_value` / `caml_input_value`: ocamlc (writes .cmi/.cmo), jsoo (reads a whole DATA section), coq (both, for .vo), infer (summary blobs, with closures) |
| `compare_hash` | `compare_val` and `caml_hash` (`runtime/compare.c`, `runtime/hash.c`) under Map, Set and Hashtbl: cpdf, menhir, frama-c, goblint, ocamlformat, `devkit_network`, ocamlc |
| `c_side_allocation` | C allocating in the OCaml heap (`Alloc_small`, `caml_alloc_shr`, `caml_modify`): coq's VM, cpdf's flate stubs |
| `custom_blocks` | `caml_alloc_custom[_mem]` and its custom ops, *including* the `finalize` op (for a Bigarray, the runtime's `caml_ba_finalize`, which is what frees the off-heap data): zarith, owl, liq-video-frames, decompress, `devkit_gzip`, pplacer, infer |
| `bigarrays` | `caml_ba_alloc` and Bigarray access, a subset of `custom_blocks`: owl, liq-video-frames, decompress, pplacer, ocamlc |
| `ffi_bulk` | hot C kernels behind a thin OCaml driver: pplacer, zarith, irmin, owl, cpdf, `devkit_gzip`, `alt_ergo_unsat_smt2`, infer |
| `off_heap_accounting` | the `mem` argument of `caml_alloc_custom_mem` against the major-GC pacer: liq-video-frames |
| `lwt` | Lwt bind chains: irmin (coverage of the pattern; its hot path is hashing) |
| `io_uring` / `ocaml_finalisers` | coverage gaps: no program exercises them, so a run with one of these tags aborts with "no benchmarks remain". The `cold:` and `gap:` notes in the tags block say what is close and what would close it. Note `ocaml_finalisers` is the `Gc.finalise` API alone; custom-block finalisation is covered, under `custom_blocks` |

### Build and run everything locally

The same three phases CI runs, driven off
[`benchmarks/manifest.yml`](benchmarks/manifest.yml) (the program list):

```bash
python3 scripts/ci-manifest.py check             # manifest vs. tree (seconds)
bash scripts/ci-build-all.sh                     # build every program (all steps + legacy)
bash scripts/ci-run-all.sh                       # run the small step of each tool once
ONLY="jsoo_small goblint_gen_small" bash scripts/ci-run-all.sh  # or just a few
```

When adding a benchmark, add it to the manifest in the same commit as its build script since the CI `check` fails if the two disagree.

### Clean

```bash
make clean          # remove build artifacts, keep vendored sources
make clean-all      # remove everything generated (duniverse/, vendor/, _rocq_prefix/, _build*)
make setup          # repopulate from the lock file
```

## How it works

1. Dependencies are locked once (`opam monorepo lock`) into
   `macro-benches.opam.locked`, which is committed.
2. `opam monorepo pull` downloads all of them into `duniverse/`.
3. `setup-monorepo.sh` applies a set of source patches for newer compilers,
   known upstream bugs, and platform differences.
4. The few packages that are not opam/dune (pplacer, apron, rocq) are vendored and built by their own scripts.
5. `dune build` compiles everything from local source with whichever compiler is on `PATH`, into a per-runtime `_build-<runtime>/` directory so different runtimes do not clobber each other.

Third-party versions all come from `sources.yml`, pinned to commits. To bump any of the sources, change that file and rerun `make setup`.

## Build-script contract

A `benchmarks/<tool>/<tool>.build.sh` is called with the runtime's opam switch
already activated, so its compiler and `dune` are on `PATH`. It reads:

| Variable | Meaning | Fallback when unset |
|---|---|---|
| `RUNNING_OCAML_BENCH_DIR` | the benchmark's own directory (`benchmarks/<tool>/`) | the script's own directory |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_OUTPUT` | where to write the binary (absolute) | `<bench dir>/<tool>-<runtime>` |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_RUNTIME_NAME` | runtime tag, e.g. `ocaml-5.5.0` | `runtime` |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH` | the active opam switch | unset |
| `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH_PREFIX` | that switch's prefix path (optional; honoured if an orchestrator sets it) | resolved from `RUNNING_OCAML_SWITCH`, else the `ocamlc` on `PATH` |

## Layout

```text
benchmarks/<tool>/   build script + input data (and driver .ml for custom benches)
benchmarks/manifest.yml     the program list                (committed)
docs/benchmarks/     one page per benchmark: what it runs and how to read it
scripts/             setup-monorepo.sh and the vendor-*.sh helpers
sources.yml          pinned versions of every third-party source
dune-overlays/       hand-written dune files for non-dune packages
duniverse/           vendored dependency sources          (generated, gitignored)
vendor/              manually vendored non-dune packages   (generated, gitignored)
macro-benches.opam.locked   the lock file                 (committed)
```

## More documentation

- [docs/benchmarks/](docs/benchmarks) has a (AI generated) page per benchmark.
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) has the operational detail beyond the build-script
  contract above: the CI phases, the in-process iteration and ring-size
  mechanics, the vendored-source patch table, the platform notes, the
  runtime-feature coverage matrix and known gaps, the backlog, and the gotchas worth knowing (useful info for LLMs).
